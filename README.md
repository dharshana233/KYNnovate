Community Sentiment Analysis - KYNNOVATE Hackathon Project

1. Team Members
Dharshana
Akalya
We worked together enthusiastically to design and build this model with a shared interest in advancing technology.

2. About the Project
Our project focuses on real-time sentiment analysis of community posts and comments. It identifies trending topics, generates actionable insights, and helps in understanding community sentiment dynamically.

3. Why We Chose This Problem Statement
We chose this problem statement because sentiment analysis provides significant value in areas like community management, marketing, and social media moderation. Addressing this challenge can help improve engagement and foster positive interactions.

4. Existing Solutions
Existing sentiment analysis tools include basic models that analyze sentiment at a static level. These tools are often limited in real-time adaptability and comprehensive analysis capabilities.

5. Disadvantages of Existing Solutions
Lack of real-time processing
Limited scalability for large datasets
Inability to integrate trending topic identification dynamically
Minimal actionable insights for improving engagement

6. Our Solution
Our model uses advanced machine learning pipelines to provide:

Real-time sentiment analysis
Identification of trending topics
Comprehensive sentiment reports
Actionable insights tailored for community management

7. Advantages
Dynamic, real-time analysis
Provides detailed reports and actionable insights
Identifies trending topics for better community engagement
Scalable for large datasets and adaptable for various platforms

8. Advancements That Can Be Made
Multilingual sentiment analysis
Integrating voice-based inputs for sentiment analysis
Improved real-time visualizations with advanced dashboards
Incorporating deep learning for better context understanding

9. The Four Key Requirements We Focused On
Real-time sentiment analysis
Trending topics identification
Sentiment reports generation
Providing actionable insights

10. Architecture
Input Layer: Accepts posts/comments via file or real-time input simulation.
Processing Layer: Machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis, trending topic identification, and insights generation.
Output Layer: Displays insights, reports, and trending topics through an interactive Streamlit interface.

11. Tools We Used
Software Requirements
Python
Libraries: Transformers, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
Google Colab for initial development
GitHub for version control
Hardware Requirements
64-bit operating system
4GB+ RAM (recommended)

12. How to Execute
    
In Google Colab
Upload the .ipynb file to Google Colab.
Install required libraries by running the respective commands (!pip install ...).
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and display results.
Export necessary files (e.g., reports, trends) for local use.
In Command Prompt (Streamlit)
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KYNnovate.git
cd KYNnovate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the interactive interface at http://localhost:8501.
